How do I approach designing software?  
  Q: What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?  
  A: My skills in integrating classes and methods have largely improved, along with working with separate code bases.  
  Q: What design process did you follow for your project work?  
  A: With the initial code given contained in a single .cpp file, the project was difficult to navigate and expand upon. To remedy this, I initially broke the project  
    into smaller components. I also thought the project would benefit from model loading so that became a high priority that was addressed.  
  Q: How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?  
  A: Modularity and functional programming I believe are integral to developing high quality code. I am now more familiar with working on pre-established code bases and 
    modifying them to better meet design goals.

How do I approach developing programs?  
  Q:What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?  
  A: Working with Enums and tieing seperate .cpp files together was a novelty with this project.  
  Q: How did iteration factor into your development?  
  A: How the classes behaved together and how to classify the components was the primary change iterated on. The program's structure was the greatest hurtle that was         overcome  
  Q: How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?  
  A: Mostly, my approach has changed with how I handle class structures. For instance, I had not used vectors before to contain class objects. Doing so allowed for more      modularity

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
  Q: How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  
  A: One of most significant insights from the course has been the value of linear algebra and matrices computations. Also, different methods of calculating desired        results.
